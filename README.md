## 1. Introduction
This PC build is an Intel-based budget-tier gaming PC suitable for light 720p gaming. The budget allotted is ₱20,000 with a 5% allowance for the total price, thus challenging a build that would be competent and comparable to today’s standards. Components were chosen with price and compatibility in mind to balance good performance with low costs.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
- **CPU + CPU Cooler + GPU:** The Intel Core i3-12100 comes with a stock fan, and it uses the Intel UHD Graphics 730. 
- **CPU + Motherboard:** The Intel Core i3-12100 uses the LGA1700 socket, which is supported by the ASRock H610M-HDV/M.2 + D5. BIOS compatibility is ensured since the H610 is designed for 12th Gen Intel processors. 
- **RAM:** The Kingston FURY Beast DDR5 is supported by the ASRock motherboard, which has DDR5 DIMM slots of up to 64GB.
- **Storage:** The Teamgroup MP33 512GB NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen3 x4, M.2 2280) is fully compatible with the motherboard, which includes an M.2 slot supporting PCIe Gen3 drives.
- **PC Case:** The case supports Micro-ATX motherboards. It has enough clearance for the stock CPU cooler and PSU.
- **Case Fan:** The case supports standard 120mm fans at the top, rear, and PSU area.
- **PSU:** Without a dedicated graphics card to power, a 500W PSU is more than sufficient. It fits the case.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit:** ₱20,000 
- **Final Total:** ₱19,430  
- ✅ Within budget
- **Notes on Trade-offs**
  - Due to budget constraints, we opted to use an Intel Core i3 processor. While older Intel Core i5 processors were considered, most options within this range are from the 10th Generation and are slightly more expensive than the i3-12100. Although these i5 processors generally feature more cores and threads, benchmark results indicate that they do not deliver a significant performance advantage over the i3-12100.
  - For the CPU cooler, we chose to stick with the stock fan that comes with the processor. Since the Intel Core i3-12100 does not generate excessive heat, the stock cooler is sufficient for our needs.
  - We decided to go with a 512GB SSD instead of a 1TB SSD to stay within budget. While the capacity is smaller, the SSD provides fast and efficient performance, which makes up for the limited storage space.
  - As part of the cost-saving decision, we also opted out of adding additional storage drives.
  - For the graphics card, we chose to rely on the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 730 that comes with the CPU. Given the budget limitations, the only dedicated graphics card available in this price range is the GT710. However, the GT710 is outdated and does not provide any real performance improvements. In fact, benchmarks show that the Intel UHD Graphics 730 outperforms the GT710.
  - The selected PSU, the Thermaltake Smart RGB 500W, is not Bronze, Silver, or Gold certified. However, it carries an 80 Plus certification, which ensures greater power efficiency compared to generic, non-certified PSUs.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
  PCPartPicker's reference for pricing comes from international vendors, mainly consisting of Australia, North America, and Europe. Converting prices from USD to PHP, parts are being offered locally at a much cheaper price range than those overseas. In doing this case study, we were able to find cheaper equivalents of the part as opposed to those in PCPartPicker, some of which were even offered at discounted rates. The only part in the local build that was more expensive than that of its PCPartPicker counterpart was the Power Supply, costing $39.95 (roughly ₱2,320) in PCPartPicker and being offered by EasyPC for ₱2,380. A small price difference for two products that offer the same specifications.

  Despite this being the case for this study, some parts do become more expensive in the Philippines due to shipping costs and other added import taxes.
  
  Given the budget, we had difficulties finding parts that could fit the budget while still being compatible with each other in both the PCPartPicker and local vendors. Doing this requires a lot of patience and research, especially if you are unfamiliar with checking specifications for compatibility and performance. Checking for availability and looking for ready alternatives to replace unavailable stocks also adds to the canvassing process, since you would like to find alternatives that would compensate for the ideal part.

  There is more to picking PC components than just listing down how we want our machine to perform and picking parts as we please. We need to be aware of other factors that may affect this such as our budget, the availability and accessibility of components, their specifications, and what that means for the machine’s performance, along with their compatibility. Added to this are the physical aesthetics of the build, if upgrades are wanted in the future, and considering if other add-ons (i.e., new fans, lights, etc.) are needed.
